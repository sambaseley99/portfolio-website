                <div class="collapsibleContent">
                    <p> Well, I guess I should consecrate this page with something. I've been surprised with how easily I've picked up HTML & CSS. Not really sure if it's very easy to pickup, or whether university has actually taught me something. I'd like to thank W3Schools.com again for their excellent resources that make learning so much easier. <br><br> I suppose I should talk about what's next for me. Currently I'm job hunting, with this site being a means to an end for that. I also want to develop my skills more. I have a list of summer projects that I want to get done:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Move main workspace to Linux.</li>
                        <li>C++ coding background decoration for the site.</li>
                        <li>Retrying my C++ chess project.</li>
                        <li>A small mini-game using a free game engine. (Godot probably)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Hopefully I can get most of these done. Obviously these will all help me add to my skills and as such my employment prospects. However, I need to balance this with job applications.<br> There's no rest for the wicked. :) <br><br> Stay fresh cheese bags!</p>

                <button type="button" class="collapsibleButton">2024/07/18 : TTRPG lessons for Game Design.</button>
                <div class="collapsibleContent">
                    <p>One of my hobbies aside from gaming is running and taking part in TTRPGs (Tabletop Role Playing Games). This includes well known ones such as 'Dungeon and Dragons', but also more obscure ones such as 'Stars Without Number' or 'Delta Green'. I personally usually take on the role of GM (Game Master) the person behind the scenes who prepares and acts as every other character or monster the players come across. I suppose I'm drawn to this so I can fulfil my craving for power, and to inflict pain on others.<br><br>
                        Over my multiple years of being on both sides of the table though I have picked up many things, and I strongly believe that TTRPGs provide a perfect place to understand game design and narrative flow. This comes from several aspects inherent to TTRPGs.
                    </p>
                    <h4>YOU ARE FACE TO FACE:</h4>
                    <p>Or discord call to discord call depending on your group. This still means though that being a GM you get IMMEDIATE feedback on your ideas. No questionnaires, no statistics logging, nothing between you and the players. Now understand, I'm not suggesting you put forward an idea and then ask them about what they think. The greatest tool the GM has is their ears. Players will naturally talk to each other, listen in, are they excited? have they gone a different direction than you expected? Are they doing anything at all? If needs be, ask them after the session what they thought of certain things.</p>
                    
                    <h4>LETTING PLAYERS DIRECT YOU:</h4>
                    <p>Many GMs start with a narrative plan. An overarching plot or setting that they will try and gently send the players down. This also leads you to one of many lessons that GMs will learn; Players will never do what you expect them to do. For an example, I will tell a story from my most recent campaign I am GMing.<br><br>
                        This takes place in the 'Delta Green' role-playing system where government agents to the enigmatic Delta Green organisation are deployed to secure the world against Lovecraftian horrors without the public's knowledge. The basic plot was the three players were tasked with clearing up the personal effects of another agent who had died recently. On searching his apartment they found a paper-trail in his copious legal documents that mentioned he owned a cabin far off in the woods. Knowing that they needed to clear all evidence, once they had cleaned the apartment they then moved onto the cabin.<br><br> 
                        It turns out that the deceased agent was not as aboveboard as he seemed to be, and was collecting tomes containing rituals and forbidden knowledge which he had been hiding at this cabin. The other thing he hid there was his wife. The agent was suddenly bereaved when his wife passed away to normal medical reasons. Using his position he collected arcane knowledge in an attempt to bring his wife back from the dead. What he actually did though was possess her body with an unearthly entity who tried to trick him into letting it go. The agent then kept this abomination in the cabin's sizeable septic tank unable to bring himself to destroy the thing inhabiting his wife's body.<br><br>
                        A heart wrenching tale that is distinctly human, with a splash of horror, and an almighty mess to deal with.<br><br>
                        The plan was for the players to find this out and either be persuaded by 'what was once her' to release her from the septic tank, or to destroy her in a fight, where the only way to completely remove her was to burn the body until there was nothing left. Understandably my players figured not to trust her, so went with option 2. This resulted in a shootout as they fought this Lovecraftian corruption of the human form. What happened next is the important part.<br><br>
                        Standing over the corpse of 'what was once her' they debated what to do while applying first-aid to themselves. It was decided to try and take the body back to the government for them to study. Not something I had thought of. They then proceeded to place the body in a locker and transport it via car back to the nearest location. Slowly 'What was once her' healed out of sight inside the locker in the back of the car. Then midway back, all hell broke loose. She broke out of the locker and a fight broke out inside the car. The driver was thrown off and crashed the car with all inside, causing one of the agents to outright die, and the other two to be seriously injured.<br><br>
                        The fight continued after the crash which ended with the two remaining agents killing and burning the body of 'what was once her'. They then sat on the side of the road waiting for a helicopter to come pick them up and remove the remains of the body. The two agents had a argument about deciding to not burn the body initially which has cascaded in further sessions to the two agents forming a very hostile relationship with each other, only keeping their hands clean due to having higher ups to explain to. (Note: This is the player's characters. Both players are perfectly friendly with each other.)<br><br>
                        This drama was only created by player decision. I merely went along with what they decided and acted how I believe the situation warranted. This improvement on my own designs by just allowing the players to go against the script I had planned is something that can used as a tool. By Forming smaller narrative elements by following what the player will logically do instead of "railroading" them into a forced path, the narrative is strengthened and more realistic and engaging.<br><br>
                        Minor rant over, onto the next point.</p>

                    <h4>FREEFORM GAME WORLDS AND DIRECTING THE PLAYERS:</h4>
                    <p>The great appeal of TTRPGs is the ability to do anything. There's no game borders. No asset limits. No storage requirements. Go where you want, and do what you want. This proposes an interesting question though. How do you get the players going in a certain direction? Luckily most players are willing to help out. They understand they COULD do anything, but the more fun and entertaining content will be what the GM has planned. But just because they want to follow the path the GM has for them doesn't mean they will automatically go down it. Videogames are able to overcome this with systems like map markers, or quests telling you what to do. However, you don't need these perse.<br><br>
                        I personally like to think of game narrative as threads. Little strings of information that the player picks up. These should have a logical objective that can be performed due to finding it. The problem is that sometimes people will not understand a thread is important, not be paying attention at that point in time (it's okay, you're only human), or in another way fail to see what the GM wants them to see. This can be fixed in a couple of ways. The one I use most often is multiple threads lead to the same outcome. By having multiple chances for the players to explore the right areas you drastically reduce the chances of them getting stuck. Another way is to prompt the players with something. The human brain is truly remarkable in that it's able to recall a lot of information that it was not conciously aware of having. If players get seriously stuck, having an NPC interact with them and nudge towards a desired area/subject. You don't have to use the NPC as a puppet and directly tell them to go to X,Y,Z. Just make them remember what threads they had already come across and what that could mean.<br><br></p>

                    <p>I strongly believe that if anyone wants to get into Game Design then you should try playing a TTRPG. It is truly an enlightening experience and provides great ideas to use else where. If this has interested you in trying a TTRPG please look around online, but also locally. There's many groups about and the community is very accepting and open to new people.<br><br>
                        I hope my rant wasn't too long. I was hoping to keep this brief, but I suppose I got a little enthusiastic. :P<br><br>
                        Finally, I guess I should thank my players for providing me these experiences. I may be the GM, but TTRPGs are a totally collaborative experience, so my thanks goes out to all past and current players for ruining my perfect plans and spiking my cortisol levels on a weekly basis.</p>
