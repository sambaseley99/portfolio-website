                    <h2>Who am I:</h2>
                    <p>I'm a graduated student of Wrexham University on the Games Development course, with a predicted grade of 2:1.<br><br> I found my calling very early in life at the age of six, when I tried to put two disks into my Playstation 2 at the same time. Thinking this would create a new game that would comprise of both aspects of the games I put in... <br><br>Obviously both the disks were ruined and I was left with nothing to show for my valiant experiment. However, my curiosity and desire to make games never diminished. <br><br>Now days I don't often resort to such destructive methods of making games though.</p>

                    <h2>My Hobbies:</h2>
                    <p>When I'm not working on games, there is a good chance I am playing them.<br><br> I have a deep love for story rich RPGs (Role Playing Games) and strategy games that really make me think. A few of my personal favourite games are 'Disco Elysium', 'Outer Wilds', and 'Factorio'.<br><br> I also am the host, organiser, and game master of a TTRPG (Tabletop Roleplaying Game) group. I have played and led many systems including 'D&D 5E', 'Shadowrun 5E', and 'Stars Without Number'. The current game system we are using is 'Delta Green' which is based in the Cthulhu mythos, but in a contemporary setting.<br><br> When I get the time, I also enjoy painting miniature figurines to help indulge my more creative side.</p>
